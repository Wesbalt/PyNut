Note this list excludes conditionally essential micros.

Vitamin D is a non-essential micro. Sun exposure makes your body
synthesize it, but due to variable exposure and skin cancer concerns
dietary recommendations assume it's all taken by mouth.

The nutritional sheet does not list chloride and iodine, but table
salt consists of chloride (it's literally sodium chloride) and many
brands add iodine. Therefore salty foods will increase chloride (and
sodium) intake and iodine if added.

Some governmental bodies consider chromium as an essential mineral.
The sheet doesn't list chromium because the data comes from the US
where it's considered non-essential.
Now talk about various food sources...

Missing micros:
Chloride
Molybdenum
B7
Iodine

Constrains:
Does not mention antinutrients, mercury, "effective" protein
